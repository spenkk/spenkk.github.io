# Whoami?{: style="color: red"}
&nbsp;

<img style="padding-right: 20px;" width="284" height="284" align="left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/profile.png">I am a computer enthusiast with a passion for hacking since I was a little kid. This led me to pursue a career in offensive security. As a penetration tester, I have deep experience with performing vulnerability assessments, testing networks, web applications, mobile applications and also perform source code analysis for various technologies. I spend my free time either bug hunting on [Synack](https://www.synack.com/red-team/) or challenging myself on CTF platforms and learning new techniques. I am part of "pwntheroot" CTF group which is made by me and [0xCela](https://twitter.com/0xcela). We participate frequently in online and live hacking events from which we managed to take the first prize on "The Day When Hacking Is Legal" event multiple times.
