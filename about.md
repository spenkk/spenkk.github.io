# Whoami?

My passion for hacking since I was a little kid has led me to pursue this path. I'm currently working as a Cybersecurity Engineer where I conduct penetration tests, security audits and other vulnerability test for diverse clients. I spoke at "Cyber Defense Week Forum" with [0xCela](https://twitter.com/0xcela) where I had the chance to demonstrate external and internal attacks. I also participated on "Cyber Defense Week Hackathon" where I made multiple vulnerable labs. I spend most of my free time bug hunting on HackerOne platform, competing on CTFs and automating stuff with bash scripting or python.
