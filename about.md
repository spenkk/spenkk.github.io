# Whoami?
&nbsp;
<img style="padding-right: 20px;" width="284" height="284" align="left" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/profile.jpg">My passion for hacking since I was a little kid has led me to pursue this path. I'm currently working as a Cybersecurity Engineer where I conduct penetration tests, security audits and other vulnerability test for diverse clients. I spoke at "Cyber Defense Week Forum" with [0xCela](https://twitter.com/0xcela) where I had the chance to demonstrate external and internal attacks. I spend most of my free time bug hunting on HackerOne platform, competing on CTFs and automating stuff with bash scripting or python.
